# 🛰️ Aerospace Preparedness Command Organization (A.P.C.O.)

> ⚠️ *A.P.C.O. is an independent, civilian-led aerospace simulation and intelligence research initiative. It is not affiliated with any government or military agency.*

---

## 🧭 Overview

**The Aerospace Preparedness Command Organization (APCO)** is a multidisciplinary, open-source initiative focused on integrating:
- Civilian space & air surveillance,
- Emergency preparedness,
- Intelligence simulation,
- Quasi-military command structures, and
- Tech-based readiness training.

Our mission is to **equip individuals, families, and decentralized communities** with tools and knowledge to monitor, respond, and adapt to spaceborne, terrestrial, and information-based threats.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Build and maintain a modular aerospace monitoring system**
   - Integrate real-time satellite APIs (NASA, ESA, NOAA, USGS)
   - Track near-Earth objects (NEOs), weather patterns, orbital debris, and solar events

2. **Create an open-source intelligence training framework**
   - Satellite imagery analysis
   - Radio signal interception (legal, public)
   - Weather event and disaster prediction
   - Crisis mapping using tools like OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js

3. **Develop simulated command infrastructure**
   - Rank structure and mission briefings
   - “Simulated alerts” and training drills
   - Game-like points/reward system for readiness, community leadership, and data contributions

4. **Form a readiness-based decentralized community**
   - Decentralized identity (DID) credentials for members
   - Peer-to-peer coordination with a chain-of-command overlay
   - Optional blockchain-based tracking for mission success or command status (non-currency utility)

🔐 Core Philosophy

Preparedness Is a Human Right — Aerospace and information readiness shouldn't be limited to governments or militaries.

Knowledge Should Be Shared — Every module is open-source and designed to be replicated in rural, off-grid, and civilian scenarios.

Civil Defense Reimagined — This is about communities, not soldiers.

⚒️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/yourname/apco.git
cd apco

2. Install dependencies

# Example using Python & Node.js
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

3. Configure your .env

cp .env.example .env
# Add your NASA/NOAA API keys, OSINT tools, mapping tokens

Let me know if you want this uploaded as a real GitHub repo, or want help generating:
- An actual React dashboard or CLI simulation tool
- OSINT training materials
- Satellite API key setup and parser code

Also, would you like to integrate **rank progression**, **badge achievements**, or **Christian community missions** into APCO? I can help build that layer too.
